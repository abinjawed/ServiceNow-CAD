In computing and telecommunication, an escape character is a character which invokes an alternative interpretation on 
subsequent characters in a character sequence. 

An escape character is a type of metacharacter.

JavaScript uses the \ (backslash) as an escape character for:

\' single quote
\" double quote
\\ backslash
\n new line
\r carriage return
\t tab
\b backspace
\f form feed
\v vertical tab (Internet Explorer 9 and older treats '\v as 'v instead of a vertical tab ('\x0B). If cross-browser compatibility is a concern, use \x0B instead of \v.)
\0 null character (U+0000 NULL) (only if the next character is not a decimal digit; else it is an octal escape sequence)
\xFF character represented by the hexadecimal byte "FF"


Note that the \v and \0 escapes are not allowed in JSON strings.
